# HD-Ensemble
This repo contains 42 highly imbalanced datasets for the paper "A Hybrid Data-Level Ensemble (HD-Ensemble) for Highly Imbalance Learning". 28 of the datasets were extracted from KEEL, and 14 were manually created by ourselvies.

The Java source code of HD-Ensemble will be pulished in this repo once the manuscript has been accepted for publishing.
